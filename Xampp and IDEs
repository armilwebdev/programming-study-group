Web Development IDEs (All Free)
1. Visual Studio Code
    This has become as very popular IDE for web development. It has lots of extensions to download, tons of themes, and it's opensource, meaning
    developers can contribute and create add-ons.

2. Notepad++
    No thrills, straight to the point. It's a very basic IDE that is very light.
    https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.7.1.html

3. Atom.io
    I've used this one before, and it's similar to VS Code. The only thing that I didn't like was that it was resource heavy, or so it seemd to me. Also opensource

4. Sublime Text
    Light Weight and very versatile
